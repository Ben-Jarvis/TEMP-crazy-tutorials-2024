Hardware instructions
=====================

You should already be familiar with the project task through your work in simulation.
As a group, you will now fine-tune the best solution to fly a real quadrotor through gates. 
You should keep in mind that the sensor signals on the actual drone are noisy and less accurate than in simulation, we recommend starting slow.

Learning objectives
-------------------
- Controlling a plug-and-play drone
- Interfacing with the Python library to control the drone
- Learning the difference between code deployment in simulation and on the real drone
- Mastering different flight phases in the real world
- Reporting performance results in a scientific manner

Tasks
-----
The final deliverables which you will be graded on for this hardware practical are the following:

- Short presentation (4 slides maximum)
- Video recording of your most successfull trials (up to 2 minutes)
- Demonstration on May 27th: 3 trials (**best grade counts**), and each trial must be completed with only one battery

Presentation
------------
Length: up to 4 slides

Duration: up to 7 minutes

- 1 slide on the experimental setup (Environment layout)
- 1 slide on the strategy (Algorithm, what you spend most time on)
- 1 slide on the results (Statistics on mission time/success/...)
- 1 optional slide (with anything relevant to add)

Video of one trial
------------------
You will prepare and submit a video of one of your trials with your own obsatcles. The video should:

- Be at most 2 minutes long
- Contain no edits except speed-ups (indicate speed up factor in overlay) and text additions
- Show at least one of the team members
- Show a clock/stop watch with a physical device (i.e a timer on a phone) that indicates seconds at the beginning and at the end
- Be in mp4 format

Demonstrations
--------------

The demonstrations will take place at assigned timeslots on May 27th, between 15:15 and 2ÃŸ:00 (see :ref:`Demonstration schedule on May 27th`).

To test your algorithms in a setup as in the final demonstrations, we will offer 30 minute testing slots in prior weeks.
We will provide a booking method for you soon where you can select a timeslot.

Complementary information
-------------------------

- **Submit by Monday 26th May, 23:59** (your code with comments, the video as MP4, presentation as PPTX) in a zip file named GROUPNUMBER_LASTNAME1_LASTNAME2_LASTNAME3_LASTNAME4_LASTNAME5.zip on Moodle
- The initial position of the drone will be given one day before the final demonstration
- Each group will present the PPTX from our computer before the demonstration
- Return the drone directly after the demonstration
- Check that the returned material is complete, according to the lists in :ref:`Hardware unpacking`
- Make sure you set up and make space quickly

Overall grading for the hardware task
-------------------------------------

We will evaluate you as a group and determine your grade for this hardware task as a weighted average of the following elements:

- Presentation and video showcasing the algorithm on one of your trials (Grade 1-6, Weighting: 50%) 
- Demonstration (Grade 1-6, Weighting: 50%)

The assistants will judge your presentation right before your hardware demonstration. Your video submission to moodle will be judged separatly in the same week.

The demonstration performance will be graded according to the performance metrics defined under :ref:`Hardware Task overview` and are the same as in simulation:

- **Grade 3.5**: Take off
- **Grade 3.5 - 4.75**: For each gate passed through in the first lap you get + 0.25
- **Grade 4.75 - 6.0**: Average time over the second and third lap compared to the rest of the class
