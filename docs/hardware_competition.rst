Hardware competition
====================

In this project, the task is to design a navigation algorithm for a quadrotor to find and land on a box, then return to the starting position while avoiding obstacles fully with onboard sensors.
First, the solution can be designed and validated in a simulator based on `Webots <https://cyberbotics.com/>`_ which provides similar sensor readings and control outputs as those in the real world.
Afterwards, the solution can be fine-tuned and used to control a real crazyflie quadrotor in the physical cluttered environments.

Example - parameter log
-----------------------
- Obtain sensor readings from the drone to your laptop

Example - remote control
------------------------
- Send velocity control command from laptop to the drone

Fine tuning your method
-----------------------
- Adapt your method from simulation to the real drone script
