Leaderboard
===========

On this page, you will see the performance ranking of your algorithm updated once everyday, which is calculated with the latest files you upload to Moodle.
For privacy, we will show your nickname here, which will be defined by the zip file name of your first submission.
Do not share your code with others, we are checking your code for similatities.

Please ensure that the zip file you submit contains all files in the controllers/main folder, except for main.py and pid_controll.py, because these two files should be the same for all submissions to ensure fairness in the evaluation process.

**Notice April 25**: 1. your code will be evaluated on five randomly generated environments; 2. please save your code before the submission deadline on Moodle to avoid any potential last-minute system crashes; 3. avoid flying the drone outside of the 3x5m arena in simulation, as the real drone may not be able to localize itself accurately without textures.

**Notice May 2**: 1. There may be some obstacles outside the 3x5m arena; 2. Flying the drone higher above the obstacles is not allowed.
