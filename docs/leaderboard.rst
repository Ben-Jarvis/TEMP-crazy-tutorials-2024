===========

On this page, you will see the performance ranking of your algorithm updated once everyday, which is calculated with the latest files you upload to Moodle.
For privacy, we will show your nickname here, which will be defined by the zip file name of your first submission.
Do not share your code with others, as we have multiple tools to check the code similarity.
