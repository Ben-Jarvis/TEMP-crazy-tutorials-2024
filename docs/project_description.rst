Project description
===================

In this project, the task is to design a navigation algorithm for a quadrotor to find and land on a box, then return to the starting position while avoiding obstacles fully with onboard sensors.
First, the solution can be designed and validated in a simulator based on `Webots <https://cyberbotics.com/>`_ which provides the similar sensor readings and control outputs as those in the real world.
Afterwards, the solution can be fine-tuned and used to control a real crazyflie quadrotor in the physical cluttered environments.

Steps for the task
------------------
- All students have to perform the task in the simulator, and a leaderboard will display the real-time results based on the uploaded code.
- By a Deadline, the top 20 students will have chance to put their method on the real drone.



Performance metrics
-------------------

- Take off and explore 4
- Find the landing box and land 4.5
- Take off again and explore 5
- Land back on the staring box 5.5

- Top 20 with fastest time will do the real-world test, half 5.75 and half 6.0
