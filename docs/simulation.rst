Simulation quickstart
=====================

Simulator overview
------------------
- World model including object textures, sizes, sources
- Controller locates at the python file
- Start, pause, stop simulation in Webots UI

Cascaded control
----------------
Recall the cascaded control theory in the lecture, and show the cascaded PID control code that generates the motor speed given the desired velocity command.

Keyboard manual control
-----------------------
Load the epfl-lis.wbt world model, and fly the crazyflie quadrotor in the simulation with your Keyboard.
